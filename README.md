    The program should prompt the player to enter their name and then display a welcome message.

    The program should display the rules of the game, including how the cards are valued and how the player can win.

    The program should simulate a deck of cards and deal two cards to the player and two cards to the dealer.

    The player should be prompted to hit or stand. If the player chooses to hit, the program should deal another card. If the player chooses to stand, the program should move on to the dealer's turn.

    The dealer's turn should be simulated automatically by the program, with the dealer hitting until their hand totals 17 or more.

    The program should determine the winner based on who has the highest hand total without going over 21.

    The program should keep track of the player's score and allow them to play again if they choose.

This project will give you an opportunity to practice various C++ concepts such as variables, functions, control structures, arrays, and classes. Additionally, you can explore the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm by representing the cards and players as objects.
